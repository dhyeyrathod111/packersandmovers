                                    <p>Before choosing a Packers and Movers, be sure about your requirements and kind of services you want. Make a list of inventories includes household furniture, electronic items and potted plants. Leave behind clutters and stuffs that have not been in use since more than a year. Call the relocation service provider at home and show him all the inventories before the moving day.</p>
                                    <p>Inform all the utility service providers regarding your change of address. Return old library books and things that you have borrowed from your old neighbours. Donâ€™t pack clutters and disposal with you. Categorise the items according to their utility and pack them accordingly. You can also organise a charity sale at your garage and give redundant household items to the needy. This would also significantly reduce the load you need to transport to new destination. This will help you to cut down cost on shifting expenses.</p>
